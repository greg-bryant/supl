this folder is where i did the first supl worked examples, ending with "gallery", which I generate with:

./supl gallery.supl TEST

note that supl itself is generated with Makefile

note that I did not work on grogix in this folder. I just developed the supl translator and gallery.supl

note that some of these terminal sessions are stored in ~Proects/supl\ terminals

note that this is also a git repository. in this folder.
